# RASA-CHATBOT-PROJECT
ğŸ¤–ğŸ’¬ Project Milestone: Rasa Chatbot Implementation in Python! ğŸ’¬ğŸ¤–

Libraries used in this project:
Rasa â€“ Core framework for NLU & Dialogue Management
NLTK â€“ For text preprocessing and linguistic analysis
pandas & numpy â€“ For handling training datasets efficiently

Excited to share my recent project on Rasa Chatbot development as part of my Machine Learning journey. 

This chatbot was built using Python + Rasa framework, focusing on:
 ğŸ”¹ Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret user intent
 ğŸ”¹ Dialogue Management to handle conversations smoothly
 ğŸ”¹ Custom Actions to integrate intelligence and personalized responses
 ğŸ”¹ Training data pipelines to improve accuracy & context

Key Learnings:
 âœ… How conversational AI systems are structured
 âœ… End-to-end implementation of Rasa pipeline
 âœ… Handling intents, entities, and responses effectively

ğŸ“Œ Next Steps: Enhancing the bot with advanced NLP, APIs integration, and deploying it for real-world use cases.

ğŸ‘‰ Would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and experiences with chatbots!

ğŸ“¸ Below are some screenshots from the implementation:
 ğŸ”¹ Training data setup
 ğŸ”¹ Intent recognition & entity extraction
 ğŸ”¹ Conversation flow execution
 ğŸ”¹ Custom action responses
